I recently bought an antique Baltimore Sigwalt Number 10 letterpress / printing press off Ebay.

The chase is quite small, so I am currently using it to print my business cards for Etsy.

It was pretty rusted, but I restored it by soaking it in a vinegar bath and repainting with primer and enamel.

I couldn't find any cheap rollers, so I opted to make my own.

The roller is McMaster Carr high-temp silicone rubber, with 3d printed trucks.

The rollers were chosen because they were cheap and had a inner diameter that fit the stock rod.

The base is made of walnut.

For the lead type itself, I am using size 10 point Bembo made by Pat Reagh.
