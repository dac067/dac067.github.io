This is a wooden trunk that I use to carry an antique Sigwalt / Baltimore letterpress.


This is made from baltic birch plywood and walnut bezels.

The logo on the front is from a linocut blockprint, that I converted into a screenprint.

The straps are made from leather.
The leather is stitched directly into the wood.
