This is a picture frame that I made in the Alhambra High School woodshop. <br>
It is constructed from maple that was reclaimed from the school
bleachers and gym flooring. <br>
The designs were engraved with a laser cutter.
This project was completed in 2013 before I graduated from AHS. <br>
Thanks to Mr. Sachez and Mr. Mason.
