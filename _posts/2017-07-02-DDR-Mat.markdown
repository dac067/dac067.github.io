This is a controller mat for the video game "Dance Dance Revolution".

The player must step on the up/down/left/right directional pad in sync with the arrows on the screen. Many consumer foam pads degrade quickly
with use, so I opted to construct my own.

It is made from a Playstation One controller, aluminum roofing tiles, and plywood. I took apart the Playstation controller and soldered wires to
the copper pads corresponding to the Up, Down Left, Right, and Ground terminals.

The PCB diagram can be found here:

The copper pads on the controller are very fragile and can break off easily. I placed alligator clips on the wires and hot glued everything
in place.

The wires were then routed through grooves in the plywood and then soldered onto aluminum plates. For each button, there is a ground plate
and a direction plate. The grounds for each button are all joined together. For a step to be registered, the ground plate and the direction
plate must have electrical contact and complete the circuit.

To facilitate electrical contact, I made a wooden square that floats on top of the aluminum plates. I taped an aluminum plate on the
underside of the square. On the edges and corners, there are grooves with high density insulation foam. When the square floats over the
plates, there is no contact. When I apply pressure to the wooden square, the plates touch each other and registers the step. The foam then
pushes the plates apart and opens the circuit again.

To adjust the sensitivity of the system, I loosely screwed the wooden square onto the base. By turning the screws, I can bring the metal
plates closer together or father apart, thus adjusting the foot pressure needed for a step.
