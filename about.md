Hi my name is Davis. This is my portfolio of sorts. <br><br>

Here is an incomplete collection of projects I've completed since 2011. <br><br>

I work as an Electrical Engineer, but pursue many different hobbies on the side.

I run an Etsy store call the Fluxwood Manufactory, where I sell fine dwarven crafts and art.
